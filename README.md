RuneScape Archaeology Assistant
===============================

A small tool written in Python to help calculate useful quantities for materials and artefacts gathered from the archaeology skill in RuneScape.

Planned features:
 * List materials needed to restore an artefact.
 * Aggregate needed materials over multiple types of artefacts and multiple numbers of the same artefact.
 * Track how many materials a user has, calculate how many more are needed, and provide what the remaining porter charges will be after getting materials.
